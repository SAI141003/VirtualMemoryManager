Virtual Memory Manager

A lightweight educational tool that demonstrates how operating systems manage memory through paging and page-replacement algorithms.
It provides an interactive GUI for exploring memory allocation, page faults, and process management.


ðŸš€ Features
	â€¢	Paging Simulation â€“ Visualize how logical addresses are translated to physical frames.
	â€¢	Page Replacement â€“ Supports FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms with step-by-step display.
	â€¢	Process Manager â€“ Add/remove processes and watch their memory usage in real time.
	â€¢	Interactive GUI â€“ Clean interface built with Python for better understanding of memory concepts.
	â€¢	Statistics Dashboard â€“ Track hits, misses, and fault rates for each algorithm.
